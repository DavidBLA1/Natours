This is my practice project from the **Advanced CSS and SASS** course on Udemy.  
The goal of this project is to learn and apply modern CSS techniques with **SASS**.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` → main HTML file
- `sass/` → source SASS files
- `css/` → compiled CSS files
- `img/` → project images
